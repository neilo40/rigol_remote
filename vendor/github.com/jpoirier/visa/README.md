Description
===========

Package visa wraps National Instruments VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) driver. The driver
allows a client application to communicate with most instrumentation buses including GPIB, USB, Serial, and Ethernet.
The Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA) is a standard for configuring, programming, and troubleshooting
instrumentation systems comprising GPIB, VXI, PXI, serial (RS232/RS485), Ethernet/LXI, and/or USB interfaces.

The package is low level and, for the most part, is one-to-one with the
exported C functions it wraps. Clients would typically build an instrument
specific driver around the package but it can also be used directly.
